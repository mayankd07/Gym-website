 		 	  	    		<h4>Strength Training Equipment</h4>
 		 	  	    		<span class="fa fa-angle-up"></span>
 		 	  	    	</div>
 		 	  	    	<div class="body">
 		 	  	    		<p>1. Dumbbells
-A staple in most weight rooms, dumbbells are a good place to start if you�re new to strength training. Most gyms are equipped with dumbbells ranging from 1 to 100 pounds. �They�re really good for strength building,� says Harris. �They are more joint friendly. Because your hands aren�t in a fixed position, they allow your body to move in a more natural motion.</p>
<p>2. Barbells-
Nope, these aren�t just for Olympic lifters and bodybuilders. Barbells can be a lifter�s best friend for moves like back squats, deadlifts and snatches. �Barbells allow you to go so much further [than dumbbells] because you can add on so much more weight,� says Harris, referring to the 2.5 to 45-pound weighted plates you can side onto to each side of the metal bar. Keep in mind, the bar itself can weigh anywhere from 45 pounds, so be sure to figure that into your calculation. And if you�re not quite ready to go heavy, opt for fixed barbells (which are usually grouped together on a rack and start at 10 or 20 pounds).
</p>
<p>3. Body Bars-
Body bars are iron bars covered in foam rubber, making them a friendlier (and lighter weight) alternative to standard barbells. �These bars allow users to perform all types of barbell exercises with weight that can be easy to use for beginners,� says McCall. For experienced lifters, while body bars may not provide enough of a challenge for your main set, Harris suggests using them to warm-up for exercises requiring a standard barbell. Or, put them to use in this 5-move BodyPump circuit for beginners.</p>
<p>4. Kettlebells-
The cannonball-like weight with a single loop handle looks like something out of Game of Thrones but it�s a great way to build power. Many of the classic kettlebell exercises, like kettlebell swings and cleans, require you to move the weight quickly and powerfully. (It�s also a sneaky way to work in some heart pumping cardio.) And, since the weight isn�t balanced like a dumbbell and shifts when you move it, your body must work harder to stabilize. �Kettlebells teach your body to adapt to changing center of gravity,� says Harris. Never used kettlebells before? It�s worth asking a trainer for some pointers on good form.</p>

<p>5. Resistance Bands-
They may look like giant colored rubber bands, but resistance bands provide a surprisingly effective workout. �It�s low-impact and joint friendly,� says Harris. �Since the band creates resistance in both directions, it forces your body to stay stable while in motion.� Choose your desired resistance level, length and style (you�ll find everything from tube bands with handles to flat bands to closed looped bands), and get accustomed to that tension. Resistance bands are perfect for exercises like overhead presses, squats and lateral band walks (a seriously effective dynamic warm-up move!). Bands can also be a good intro to strength training for someone who�s new to the gym and an easy-to-pack piece of equipment when you travel.</p>
<p>6. TRX
-The unassuming straps hanging from your gym�s ceiling are really an all-in-one gym. �There are a huge variety of exercise you can do,� says Harris. �One of the biggest benefits is it�s a [dynamic] as opposed to isolated movement. You work multiple muscle groups at once.� For example, slip your feet into the TRX handles and your regular push-up turns into a core and shoulder-stabilizing move. And since you�re using just your bodyweight, you can adjust the resistance by moving your feet closer (less resistance) or further (more resistance) away from the anchor point.
</p>
<p>7. Parallettes-
Commonly used by gymnasts and CrossFit athletes, parallettes let you test (and push) the limits of your physical strength. �Gymnastics exercises are excellent bodyweight training for developing strength and definition, but not many gyms have space for parallel bars. [Parallettes] are smaller bars that allow you to do exercises like handstand push-ups, L-sits an other gnarly feats of strength,� says McCall. And since they�re raised off the ground, you can move into a deeper range of motion with each exercise.</p>
<p>8. Battle Ropes-
Looking for an intense but stress-relieving workout? Try battle or battling ropes. (Cue baller inspiration HERE.) Grab one of these giant ropes in each hand and begin lifting the rope up and down explosively, creating waves. The higher the wave, the more energy you�re pouring into the rope. �The challenge is keeping them moving at a fast rate,� says McCall. �Using battling rope is like doing sprints for your upper body.� And you can�t cheat. �They�re really good for fixing imbalances because you�re using both sides of the body to do separate work,� says Harris. �You don�t have one side overcompensating for the other.� Plus, talk about forearm and grip strength!</p>

 		 	  	    		<p>Increase your commitment to a fitness routine: �Working out with a crowd carries a plethora of intertwined benefits that include enhancing consistency, duration, motivation, conversation and inspiration,� says Dian Griesel, Ph.D., co-author of TurboCharged and president of public relations firm DGI. �Workouts with others improve consistency because they involve a commitment. �No shows� and cancellations get noticed by others and positive peer pressure can help curtail the urges to skip a workout � or quit.�

One study found that 95 percent of those who started a weight-loss program with friends completed the program, compared to a 76 percent completion rate for those who tackled the program alone. The friend group was also 42 percent more likely to maintain their weight loss.

�For most people, it�s difficult to stay consistent with workout routines, but having a certain group there waiting for you provides you with the motivation and accountability everyone needs to be successful,� says Michael Yabut, Training Manager and National Trainer at TITLE Boxing Club International, LLC, who agrees that members of group fitness programs are less likely to skip workouts, which helps keep them on track.</p>
